I solved the problem with two way

First one;
- Program reads file line by line
- Create an object from each line
- Check Object's time stamp for spesific time
- Calculate played song count for each client with each coming object and add it to a dictionary
- Calculate distinct played count from dictionary which is filled in above step and add it to a new dictionary
- Bind dictionary to datagrid so user can see the result
- Show operation time for upload and analyze the data

Operation time : 8 sec





Second one;
- Program reads all file and create a object list
- Use lambda expressions to;
  - Check Object's time stamp for spesific time
  - Calculate played song count for each client
  - Calculate distinct played count and return a dictionary
  - Bind dictionary to datagrid so user can see the result
 - Show operation time for upload File
 - Show operation time for analyze the data
  
  Operation Time for Upload : 7 sec
  Operation Time for Analyze: 0.8 sec
